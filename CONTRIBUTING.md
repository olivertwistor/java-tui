# Contributing to this project

I'm honoured that you are interested in contributing to my project. Open source is all about community and collaboration. People like you make it all possible.

A good way to contribute is to look for typos or things that don't seem right, and [open an issue](https://github.com/olivertwistor/java-tui/issues/new). Better yet, if you're feeling so inclined, you may work on a fix yourself and when you're done, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). If your fix is accepted by me, it will be included in this project.

I only use GitHub issues for things reported by you, not for all tasks in the whole project. An empty issue list doesn't necessarily mean that there is no ongoing development. I use an offline project manager to better be able to plan my work.

## Code of conduct

Open source should be as inclusive as possible. I have a zero tolerance policy regarding discrimination of any kind. Try to be mindful of how you communicate with other users on GitHub. Behind the usernames are real people, and if you find someone who creates a "stupid" issue, comment or pull request, I urge you to be respectful. They may be a beginner, which we have all been at one time.

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:oliver_twistor@hotmail.com) if you have any questions about this or if you have had a bad experience with this community.
