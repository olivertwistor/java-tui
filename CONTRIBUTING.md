# Contributing to this project

I'm happy you're interested in contributing to this project. The open source community depends on people like you, and together we can make this project as good as it can possibly be. Thank you!

## Code of conduct

The open source community should be open and welcoming for all. I have a zero tolerance policy against discrimination of race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability etc.

I urge everyone to be respectful to each other and remember that behind that username is a human being. If someone makes a mistake or makes a "stupid" comment or question, please bear in mind that they may be a beginner, something everyone has once been.

Feel free to contact me through my [GitHub page][1] if you have any questions or complaints regarding this or anything else.
