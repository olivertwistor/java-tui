# How to contribute to this project
I'm happy that you are interested in contributing to this project. The open 
source community depends on people like you, and together we can make this 
project as good as it can possibly be. Thank you!

This document describes, first of all, code of conduct (a very important read), 
then some ideas of with what you may contribute and, last but not least, 
explanations on what you must do to start working on an issue and get your work 
merged into this project.

## Code of conduct
The open source community should be open and welcoming for all. I have a zero 
tolerance policy against discrimination of race, ethnicity, religious 
affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability etc.

I urge everyone to be respectful to each other and remember that behind that 
username is a human being. If someone makes a mistake or makes a "stupid" 
comment or question, please bear in mind that they may be a beginner, something 
everyone has once been.

Feel free to e-mail me at [oliver_twistor@hotmail.com][1] if you have any 
questions or complaints regarding this or anything else.

## Contribution ideas
There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project. Some of them 
are listed in the following subsections.

### Start working on an open issue
One very practical way in which you can contribute is to take a look at the 
[list of open and unassigned issues][3] to see if there is anything you want to 
help out with. For information on the necessary steps for that, please read the 
section *[How to make changes to the project][4]*.

### Report bugs, propose new features or changes in existing features
All software has bugs and I would very much appreciate help with identifying and 
reporting bugs, so they can be fixed. This is a good way to contribute even if 
you aren't a programmer.

When you have used this application for a while, you may come up with some 
ideas of cool new features, or annoyances in existing features which you would 
want to have changed. I very much appreciate new ideas on how to improve this 
application.

#### How to create a new issue

1. Go to the [new issue][2] page.
1. Write a short and succinct *title*.
1. Provide more details in the *comment* field if the title isn't enough.
1. If you don't have repository access, skip to the next step.
    1. Select an *assignee* that should handle the issue. If you're not 
    selecting yourself, you should probably leave this blank.
    1. Choose *labels*, for example *bug* for bugs and *enhancement* for new or 
    changed features.
    1. Leave *Project* blank since that is best determined at a later date, 
    unless you're sure that the issue really should be part of the upcoming 
    release. 
    1. Leave also *Milestone* blank for the same reason as for *Project*.
1. Press the button *Submit new issue*.

## How to make changes to the project
I've found an excellent article on how to fork a repository, work on an issue 
and then do a pull request to have your changes merged into the target 
repository.
