## Code of conduct
The open source community should be open and welcoming for all. I have a zero 
tolerance policy against discrimination of race, ethnicity, religious 
affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability etc.

I urge everyone to be respectful to each other and remember that behind that 
username is a human being. If someone makes a mistake or makes a "stupid" 
comment or question, please bear in mind that they may be a beginner, something 
everyone has once been.

Feel free to contact me through [my Github page][1] if you have any questions 
or complaints regarding this or anything else.

## Contribution ideas
There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project. Some of them 
are listed here.

### Start working on an open issue
One very practical way in which you can contribute is to take a look at the 
[list of open and unassigned issues][3] to see if there is anything you want to 
help out with. For information on the necessary steps for that, please read the 
section *[How to make changes to the project][4]*.

### Report bugs, propose new features or changes in existing features
All software has bugs, and I would very much appreciate help with identifying 
and reporting bugs, so they can be fixed. This is a good way to contribute even 
if you aren't a programmer yourself.

#### How to create a new issue
1. Go to the [new issue][2] page.
1. Write a short and succinct *title*.
1. Provide more details in the *comment* field if the title isn't enough.
1. If you have repository access, read on. Otherwise, skip to the next step.
    1. Select an *assignee* that should handle the issue. If you're not
    selecting yourself, you should probably leave this blank.
    1. Choose the appropriate *labels* (you may choose multiple labels if you 
    want):
        * for a bug, choose *bug*
        * for a design decision, choose *design*
        * for a documentation related issue, choose *documentation*
        * for a feature, choose *coding*
        * for other things not listed here, leave the *labels* blank or create
        new labels as appropriate
    1. Leave *Project* blank.
    1. Also leave *Milestone* blank.
1. Press the button *Submit new issue*.
